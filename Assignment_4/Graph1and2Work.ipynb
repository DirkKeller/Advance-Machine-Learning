    "In this second part of the assignment, you will apply the PC algorithm to the biological dataset of Sachs et al. (2005). In this dataset, the columns represent 11 different proteins, which were measured in thousands of human immune system cells. Each row is a single cell. The cells were prepared in different ways, by adding different chemicals some time before the measurements were made. A twelfth column, labeled `experiment`, indicates in which way that cell was prepared. We can think of `experiment=1` as denoting the observational data, and other values of `experiment` (2 through 14) as various interventional datasets."

    "For the next part, you will need to install the package [tigramite](https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite). Here are three different ways in which you might be able to install it, in the order in which we recommend you to try them:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. If not in a conda environment, follow the README on github.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the PC algorithm on data, we need to perform (conditional) independence tests. Tigramite implements several such tests. The simplest of these tests is `ParCorr()`. It assumes the data come from a linear structural causal model, which they actually don't. We will use it anyway, because the alternatives (such as `CMIknn()` (Runge, 2018)) are more effort to install and orders of magnitude slower, while `ParCorr()` usually already gives decent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a statistical test, a conditional independence test works by computing a p-value. If a conditional independence exists, this p-value will be approximately uniformly distributed on the interval between 0 and 1. If the variables being tested are conditionally dependent, the p-value will be close to 0. PC wants to know a binary answer, so we will pick some threshold alpha and declare an independence if the p-value is larger than alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical testing, alpha is often taken to be 0.05 or smaller. For PC, it may be more appropriate to pick a larger alpha instead. This is because as soon as PC finds a (conditional) independence between two variables, it will delete the edge between them and do no more tests between those two variables. If this happens while it shouldn't have, PC can't put the edge back. But in the reverse situation, if PC leaves an edge in place while it should have deleted it, there is still a possibility that the edge will be deleted later, when another test between those two variables reports a more convincing independence."
